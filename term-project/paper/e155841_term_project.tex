\begin{abstract}
    In this project, we experimented with different convolutional neural networks, ResNets and EfficientNets, to detect plant pathologies from leaf images. Since a plant may have more than one disease, the models are trained for multi-label classification. The dataset used in the training is imbalanced. Focal loss and weighted binary cross-entropy loss functions have been tried to combat class imbalance. We also demonstrated the impact of various techniques such as image augmentation, transfer learning, learning rate warm-up, low precision (fp16) training, and 1-cycle learning rate scheduling policy. We found that deeper and more complex models don't always yield higher performances than simpler models. We hypothesize this to be due to the effectiveness of training techniques applied.

\section{Introduction}

Apple industry in U.S. has \$15 billion annual market size \cite{Thapa2020}. 
Various kinds of plant diseases cause significant economic losses. 
The manual diagnosis of apple plant diseases are laborous and expensive. 
Hence, computer vision-based methods have been developed to detect diseases from the images of leaves. 
The variations in imaging conditions such as backgrounds, lighting, and the large variety of visual symptoms are the main challenging aspects for these methods. 

In this paper, we investigate the performance of convolutional neural networks, 
specifically, we train ResNet \cite{ResNet2016} 
and EfficientNet \cite{EfficientNet} architectures with different scales, 
on detecting plant diseases from the images of apple leaves. 

\subsection{Dataset}
We use \href{https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2021-fgvc8/overview}{Plant Pathology 2021-FGVC8 dataset} \cite{Thapa2020} for training the models. 
The dataset consists of over $18,632$ RGB images, 
varying between $2592 \times 1728$ to $5184 \times 3456$ in size, 
and their labels. Each sample is labelled by experts with one or more disease types 
due to the fact that a plant may have multiple diseases. 

There are 4 kinds of plant disease existing in the dataset:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{frog-eye leaf spot}
\item \textit{powdery mildew}
\item \textit{rust}
\item \textit{scab}
\end{itemize}

Additionally, a sample is labelled as \textit{healthy} when no disease is spotted, 
and labelled as \textit{complex} when many diseases are spotted.

    \label{fig:samples}
\end{figure}

As it can be seen from Fig.~\ref{fig:label-dist}., there is imbalance among labels in the dataset.

\subsection{Literature Search}

Tan and Le \cite{EfficientNet} analyzed model scaling in convolutional neural networks 
and shown that when network depth, width, and resolution are balanced, the model performance
improves. They proposed a new scaling method parameterized with a single coefficient and
demonstrated that when the method is applied to scale existing CNNs such MobileNet, it 
achieves higher accuracy.
To test the effectiveness of the method on a novel model architecture, first, 
they perform a neural architecture search for a convolutional block constrained 
by number of FLOPs and create full networks by scaling this block with 
the proposed scaling method.
The family of such networks with different scales is named EfficientNets.
Then, they compare the performance of EfficientNets with other well-performing
convolutional neural networks such as 
ResNet \cite{ResNet2016}, 
InceptionNet \cite{InceptionNetV1} \cite{InceptionNetV3} \cite{InceptionNetV4}, 
and MobileNet \cite{MobileNet2017} 
on several image classification datasets such as 
CIFAR \cite{CIFAR}, and ImageNet \cite{ImageNet2014}. 
They show that EfficientNets achieve highest accuracy and faster inference on 
all datasets among all models with less parameters.

The paper by He et. al is a comprehensive ablation study on convolutional neural networks.
It investigates the impact of training techniques such as 
learning rate warming, label smoothing, transfer learning, weighting loss; 
and hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate on three tasks image classification, 
object detection, and semantic segmentation with three CNN architectures
ResNet\-50 \cite{ResNet2016}, Inception\-V3 \cite{InceptionNetV3}, 
and MobileNet \cite{MobileNet2017}. The residual block of ResNet has convolutional layers 
with $1 \times 1$ kernel size and 2 stride, which ignores half of the information flowing throught the block \cite{BagOfTricks}. It also proposes a few modifications to 
Moreover, the convolutional layers with $7 \times 7$ kernel size are computationally 
more expensive than several successive $3 \times 3$ convolutions. Hence, the paper
proposes several tweaks to eliminate these inefficiencies in the original ResNet architecture.

Lin et al. \cite{FocalLoss} proposed a novel loss function that improves training accuracy in 
highly imbalanced problems such as object detection. Focal loss (Eq.\ref{eq:fl}) is a modulated 
cross entropy loss, where the modulating factor downweighs losses for easy 
negative examples such as background in object detection problems. This prevents 
easy negatives to dominate loss function and adversely influence the training.
The paper also proposes a one-stage object detection model architecture, named RetinaNet, 
that uses focal loss. It surpasses the accuracy of all two-stage object detection models 
without compromising inference speed and proves the effectiveness of focal loss.
We use focal loss in our models with the hyperparameters suggested by the paper.

\begin{equation*}
    p_T = 
    \begin{cases}
        p &\quad \text{if y = 1} \\
        1 - p &\quad \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation}
    \text{FL}(p_t) = \alpha_t (1 - p_t)^{\gamma}\log{p_t} \label{eq:fl}
\end{equation}

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Encoding}
The targets are encoded as one-hot vectors for 5 classes 
(\textit{complex}, \textit{frog-eye leaf spot}, \textit{powdery mildew}, 
\textit{rust}, \textit{scab}) and 
as zero vector for \textit{healthy} class as it implies the absence of disease.

\subsection{Model training and evaluation}
We trained several models with ResNet, EfficientNet and XResNet architectures 
with different model scales. Two model input sizes have been experimented; 
$384 \times 384 \times 3$ and $512 \times 512 \times 3$. 
The dataset is split into training and validation sets with 70-30\% ratios, respectively.

Since the task is multi-label classification, binary cross-entropy loss (Eq.\ref{eq:bce})
and focal loss (Eq.\ref{eq:fl}) functions have been used to train models. 
We trained a baseline model with ResNet18 architecture pretrained on ImageNet 
with no image augmentation and with binary cross entropy. 
\begin{equation*}
    \text{BCE} = -{(y\log(p) + (1 - y)\log(1 - p))} \label{eq:bce}
\end{equation*}

To improve model performance and training process, 
we utilized many techniques from \cite{BagOfTricks} and fastai \cite{fastai} library.
We used learning rate finder algorithm proposed by Smith \cite{Smith2015}
and implemented in fastai library to pick an optimal learning rate for fast convergence.
As learning rate scheduler, we used learning rate warmup and annealing \cite{BagOfTricks}
with 1cycle policy from \cite{Smith2018}. Alongside with focal loss, 
we experimented with weighted binary cross entropy loss with inverse 
frequencies of labels to mitigate the negative effects of class imbalance 
on model performance. 
Data augmentation is a common technique in deep learning practice due to its 
effectivess at preventing overfitting and improving model inference performance \cite{Shorten2019}.
We applied several image augmentation methods on our training set 
to increase generalization;
\begin{itemize}
    \item Horizontal and vertical flipping
    \item Translation
    \item 2D rotation
    \item Zoom in and zoom out
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width = 0.45 \textwidth]{image-aug-3x3.png}}
    \caption{Samples for the image augmentations applied on an image}
    \label{fig:image-aug}
\end{figure}

Low-precision floating point numbers (FP16) have been used 
for model weights and gradients to accelerate training 
\cite{Micikevicius2018} \cite{BagOfTricks}.
The models are evaluated with the following metrics implemented 
in scikit-learn library \cite{sklearn_api}: 
accuracy, F1 score with macro and samples averaging.

\begin{align*}
    \text{accuracy} &= \frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN} \\
    \text{F1} &= \frac{2*TP}{2*TP+FP+FN}
\end{align*}

Macro averages F1 scores by class; whereas, samples averages by instance.


The baseline corresponds to a dummy model produces uniform random probability per class. 

We benefit from transfer learning by using the models pretrained on ImageNet. Transfer learning
means using a subset of weights of a model pretrained on another dataset instead of 
creating a model from scratch with untrained weights.
The final classification layer of each pretrained model is replaced with a new fully connected layer to make them applicable to our dataset. 
They're trained by fine tuning the classification head for 5 epochs while the parameters 
of the backbone are frozen; and then,
unfreezing the whole model and training until the validation loss saturates.

The experiment results are given in Table \ref{table:experiment_results}. 
Aug. stands for image augmentation and its level. 
BCE corresponds to binary cross entropy loss; WBCE corresponds to binary cross entropy loss with 
class weights; FL corresponds to focal loss.

As it can be seen, ResNet18 architecture with light image augmentation achieves the best performance.

\section{Conclusion}

It can be concluded that deep and complex models with more trainable parameters 
don't always achieve the best performance. Neither focal loss nor weighting 
binary cross entropy loss make any improvement on the model performance. 
This might be due to the fact that the class imbalance is not very high in the dataset.
It can be stated that the model benefits from image augmentation as it generates
more samples in various angles and lighting conditions. However, when the augmentation 
is too heavy, it may distort the images such that important features are lost. Hence,
the model performance degrades.
